## Analyzing Detected Security to Understand Attack Methods and Impacts 
- Data Collection and Integration: Utilizing the advanced capabilities of the security analytics platform like **SIEM** , **IBMQradar** , **LogRhythm SIEM** to collect and integrate security data from various sources, such as **logs, network traffic, endpoint telemetry, and threat intelligence feeds**. Ensuring that all relevant data sources are properly configured and integrated into the platform.
 - Identify Patterns : Looking For the Patterns in the detected security events. This could include the types of events, their frequency, and any correlations between them. 
			   - For example, if multiple login attempts from different locations are detected within a short period, it could indicate a brute force attack.
## Working of SIEM
- Correlation and Threat Detection: Utilizing LogRhythm SIEM's correlation and threat detection capabilities to identify relationships between security events and detect potential threats. Configure correlation rules to identify patterns, anomalies, and trends that may indicate **malicious activity**, such as unauthorized access **attempts, malware infections,** or data exfiltration.

- Behavioral Analytics: Leverage LogRhythm SIEM's behavioral analytics capabilities to detect abnormal or suspicious behavior across your environment. It Analyzes **user activity, network traffic patterns, and system behavior** to identify deviations from normal behavior and potential indicators of compromise.
