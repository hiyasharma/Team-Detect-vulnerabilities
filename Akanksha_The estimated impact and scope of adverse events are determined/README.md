<h2>SEIM</h2>
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a set of tools and services offering a holistic view of an organization’s information security.<br>

**SIEM tools provide:**<br>
**.** Real-time visibility across an organization’s information security systems.<br>
**.** Event log management that consolidates data from numerous sources.<br>
**.** A correlation of events gathered from different logs or security sources, using if-then rules that add intelligence to raw data.<br>
**.** Automatic security event notifications. Most SIEM systems provide dashboards for security issues and other methods of direct notification.<br>

**SIEM works by combining two technologies:**<br>
a) Security information management (SIM), which collects data from log files for analysis and reports on security threats and events <br>
b) security event management (SEM), which conducts real-time system monitoring, notifies network admins about important issues and establishes correlations between security events.<br>

<h3>The security information and event management process can be broken down as follows:</h3>

**1)Data collection –** All sources of network security information, e.g., servers, operating systems, firewalls, antivirus software and intrusion prevention systems are configured to feed event data into a SIEM tool.Most modern SIEM tools use agents to collect event logs from enterprise systems, which are then processed, filtered and sent them to the SIEM. Some SIEMs allow agentless data collection. For example, Splunk offers agentless data collection in Windows using WMI.<br>

**2) Policies -**  A profile is created by the SIEM administrator, which defines the behavior of enterprise systems, both under normal conditions and during pre-defined security incidents. SIEMs provide default rules, alerts, reports, and dashboards that can be tuned and customized to fit specific security needs.<br>

**3)Data consolidation and correlation –**  SIEM solutions consolidate, parse and analyze log files. Events are then categorized based on the raw data and apply correlation rules that combine individual data events into meaningful security issues.<br>

**4) Notifications –** If an event or set of events triggers a SIEM rule, the system notifies security personnel.

<h3>IBM QRadar</h3><br>
IBM QRadar collects log data from sources in an enterprise’s information system, including network devices, operating systems, applications and user activities.
The QRadar SIEM analyzes log data in real-time, enabling users to quickly identify and stop attacks. QRadar can also collect log events and network flow data from cloud-based applications. This SIEM also supports threat intelligence feeds.
