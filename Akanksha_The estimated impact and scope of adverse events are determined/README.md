<h2>SEIM</h2>
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a set of tools and services offering a holistic view of an organization’s information security.<br>

**SIEM tools provide:**<br>
**.** Real-time visibility across an organization’s information security systems.<br>
**.** Event log management that consolidates data from numerous sources.<br>
**.** A correlation of events gathered from different logs or security sources, using if-then rules that add intelligence to raw data.<br>
**.** Automatic security event notifications. Most SIEM systems provide dashboards for security issues and other methods of direct notification.<br>

**SIEM works by combining two technologies:**<br>
a) Security information management (SIM), which collects data from log files for analysis and reports on security threats and events <br>
b) security event management (SEM), which conducts real-time system monitoring, notifies network admins about important issues and establishes correlations between security events.<br>
