<h1>Monitor and investigate alerts from the Alerts tabðŸ””</h1>

Investigate triggered alerts from the Alerts tab. When you view alerts from here, you can filter the list by dimensions of entities or groups to search for triggered alerts that 
are affecting entities or groups of similar dimensions.

A color-coded severity status displays the state of the alert. This allows you to easily view the state of the alert by color. Severity colors include: Green for Information,
Yellow for Medium, and Red for Critical. A severity status arrow displays alongside the severity status color in the Current Severity column, indicating whether the alert has 
improved or degraded recently.The row size in the Alerts tab is limited to two rows per entity. If resizing the window, or if the slide-out panel is activated, the dimensions 
column truncates and only displays dimensions that fit into the available two-row column size. 

The row does not expand or wrap to more than two rows, so all dimensions might not 
display. To view all of the dimensions for each entity or group, close the slide-out panel or resize your window to a larger view.
