<h1>The IBM QRadar</h1>
The IBM QRadar is a security information and event management or SIEM product that is designed for enterprises. The tool collects data from the organization and the network devices.
It also connects to the operating systems, host assets, applications, vulnerabilities, user activities, and behaviors. IBM QRadar is used to perform analysis of the log data and the
network flows in real-time so that malicious activities can be identified and stopped as soon as possible. Thus, the main aim of the IBM QRadar is to prevent or minimize the damage 
to its host organization.<br>

The IBM QRadar SIEM uses a real-time integrated Cybersecurity AI, machine learning, and behavior analytics to prevent the attacks in the blink of an eye and with a very less cost 
compared to what human supervision can ensure. QRadar can address the bulk security issues that the companies face and save a lot of money. The security teams that struggle with 
patching endpoints properly and updating them can get their problems solved with IBM BigFix that has QRadar SIEM integrated into it. Most of the common issues are solved with this.

<h2>How does SIEM work?</h2>
IBM Security QRadar takes the log data from the log sources that are used by the applications and devices in the network and consolidates them. However, it is important to take
note that the software versions for all the IBM Security QRadar appliances in a deployment must be having not only the exact versions but the same fix level.

<h2>Aspects of IBM QRadar SIEM</h2>

**1)Log activity -** Network events can be monitored and displayed in real-time and advanced searches can be performed through the IBM Security QRadar SIEM.<br>
**2)Assets -** QRadar SIEM automatically constructs the asset profiles by using the vulnerability data and passive flow data to discover the hosts and network servers.<br>
**3)Network activity -** The communication sessions between two hosts can be investigated with IBM Security QRadar SIEM.<br>
**4)Offenses -** Offenses for security issues can be investigated by QRadar.<br>
**5)Data collection -** Information in various formats is accepted by the QRadar SIEM from a vast category of devices that include network traffic, security events, and scan 
results.<br>
**6)Reports -** Custom reports and use default reports can be created in IBM Security QRadar SIEM.<br>
**7)Supported web browsers -** A supported web browser needs to be used to access all the features of the IBM Security QRadar.<br>
**8) Rules -** The QRadar SIEM rules are performed on the events, offenses, and flows. A response is generated by the rule if all the conditions of a test are met.<br>
