Comprehensive Report on System Monitoring and Analysis Scripts

Objective:
The objective of this report is to provide an overview of a set of Python scripts designed for system monitoring and analysis. These scripts utilize the psutil and winreg modules to access system resources and registry information, offering various functionalities for users to monitor and analyze processes, memory usage, and system configurations.

1. Retrieving Installation Information:

Objective: Retrieve information about installed software from the Windows Registry.
Description: This script allows users to retrieve information about installed software by accessing the Windows Registry. It searches for a specific registry key associated with installed software and retrieves relevant information such as display name, version, and installation path.
Usage: Users can execute the script and provide the name of the software they want to retrieve information about. The script will search the Windows Registry for matching entries and display the relevant information.
Example: python retrieve_installation_info.py "Google Chrome"
Recommendations: Provide comprehensive documentation detailing the usage of the script, including examples and explanations of the retrieved information. Additionally, consider implementing error handling to gracefully handle cases where the specified software is not found in the registry.
2. Retrieving Memory Details of a Process:

Objective: Retrieve detailed memory information for a specified process.
Description: This script provides users with detailed memory information for a specified process identified by its Process ID (PID). It retrieves metrics such as memory usage, CPU usage, and network activity associated with the specified process.
Usage: Users need to execute the script and provide the PID of the process they want to analyze. The script will retrieve and display detailed memory information for the specified process.
Example: python retrieve_memory_details.py 1234
Recommendations: Enhance the documentation with usage examples and descriptions of the retrieved metrics. Consider conducting thorough testing across different system configurations to ensure compatibility and reliability.
3. Monitoring and Displaying Information about New Processes:

Objective: Continuously monitor and display information about new processes as they are created.
Description: This script monitors the system for new processes and displays information about them in real-time. It provides insights into resource usage metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and network activity for each new process.
Usage: Users can execute the script, which continuously monitors the system for new processes. It dynamically updates and displays information about newly created processes.
Example: python monitor_new_processes.py
Recommendations: Provide clear instructions on how to terminate the script and handle potential issues such as high resource usage. Additionally, consider incorporating logging functionality to track script activities and errors.
4. Displaying Information about Specific Processes:

Objective: Display information about specific processes based on user-defined filters.
Description: This script allows users to filter and display information about specific processes based on criteria such as process name, process ID, and command line. It provides flexibility and customization options for users to analyze processes of interest.
Usage: Users need to execute the script and provide optional filters for process name, process ID, and command line. The script will filter and display information about processes that match the specified criteria.
Example: python display_specific_processes.py --name "chrome" --pid 1234 --cmd "google.com"
Recommendations: Include detailed explanations of the available filters and their usage in the documentation. Ensure robust error handling to handle invalid input and edge cases gracefully.
Conclusion:
These Python scripts offer valuable functionalities for system monitoring and analysis, empowering users to retrieve detailed information about installed software, processes, and system resources. By leveraging the capabilities of the psutil and winreg modules, users can gain insights into various aspects of system performance and configuration, aiding in troubleshooting, optimization, and security analysis.
